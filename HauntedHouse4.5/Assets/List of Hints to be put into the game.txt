1. Hello this is my jornal. 
I don't know much at this point but what I do know is that the way out is up
and that im not allone.

2. I have made a new discovery skeletons are not very strong but are still drawn
to my location. At least I can tell where they are by the aura that they cast on
the floor

3. I noticed that the wizards look like the skeletons from before but they are 
far stronger than that. I can feel my sanity draining, I don't know how much longer
I can last in here.

4. Pumkins are dangerous. Stay away from the ones with faces they steel sanity.
best to run away from them and stay away as much as possible.

5. Nothing kills the zombies. They keep comming after me. I can't hurt them and 
their killing me. One hit and I could barely stand. I think this might be my last 
message. I will rip out and scatter these pages in the hope to help the next victim
of this place. If you are reading this escape for my sake.
Thanks :)
